/**
 * Detailed Data Report aggregation.
 *
 * One row per (employee, project, month) — the allocation table's own storage
 * grain joined to the directory. Plan and adjustment kinds sum invisibly and
 * zero months drop, exactly as the Brand Report does, so a pivot of this report
 * by (brand, employee) reproduces the Brand Report's numbers; reconciliation is
 * structural, not a coincidence to be re-checked each release. Exact up to
 * per-row 1-decimal rounding: two 0.05h months pivot to 0.2 here but 0.1 in the
 * Brand Report, which rounds once after summing. That is deliberate — what a
 * stakeholder sees in a row is what their own pivot adds up, which is the right
 * property for a self-service dataset.
 *
 * Sort keys equal column order (Department -> Employee -> Brand -> Project ->
 * Month) so the ordering is self-evident in the sheet; ids tie-break and blank
 * departments sort last, so identical data yields byte-identical files
 * (week-over-week diffing depends on that). Hours are assumed already windowed
 * to the requested month range by the caller (getEngagements).
 *
 * Department is the employee's CURRENT department — the data model keeps no
 * department history, so somebody who moved mid-range shows their present
 * department for every month. Accepted limitation.
