/**
 * Which filters each export actually honors, and how to label them.
 *
 * The export routes don't all read the same params: the Brand Report and the
 * Detailed Data Report filter on brandIds and departmentIds and ignore
 * projectIds entirely, while Conflicts reads only employeeIds. Rendering an
 * editor for every timeline filter would
 * overstate the scope — it tells the user a filter is applied when the route
 * throws it away, so the dialog's scope fields render only for honored keys.
 *
 * Keeping this beside the query builder means the dialog never has to know which
 * route reads what. FILTER_LABELS supplies the scope fields' form labels.

 * here would make the dialog claim a brand scope the file doesn't have.
 *
 * `utilization` is the same story with departmentIds: both its routes do
 * `departmentIds.split(',').map((id) => parseInt(id, 10))`, but planner
 * department ids are UUIDs, so every parse is NaN and the filter matches
 * nothing. Listing it would render a Departments picker over a dead filter —
 * re-add the key if those routes ever compare ids as strings.

 * A key missing from an entry means that export ignores that filter.
